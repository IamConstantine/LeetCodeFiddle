Solutions to LeetCode problems in Scala


## Hints:

#### **Divide and Conquer**

1. [Search in Rotated Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) - Use Binary search approach to solve in O(log n). Find the mid and check if right is sorted first ie compare l and mid. Binary search is called a _decrease and conquer_ problem instead of _divide and conquer_.
